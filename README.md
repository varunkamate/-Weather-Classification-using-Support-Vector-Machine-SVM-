🌦️-Weather-Classification-using-Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-
🔍 Project Overview
This project is focused on building a machine learning classification model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict different weather conditions such as Sunny, Rainy, Foggy, etc., based on various meteorological features.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The notebook includes rich EDA with:

✅ Correlation heatmaps

📈 Distribution plots

📉 Class imbalance visualization

🌡️ Feature comparison between weather types
