🌦️-Weather-Classification-using-Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-
🔍 Project Overview
This project is focused on building a machine learning classification model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict different weather conditions such as Sunny, Rainy, Foggy, etc., based on various meteorological features.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The notebook includes rich EDA with:

✅ Correlation heatmaps

📈 Distribution plots

📉 Class imbalance visualization

🌡️ Feature comparison between weather types

🧠 Model Building
The classification is performed using SVM (Support Vector Machine) with the following steps:

🔍 Data Preprocessing

🧪 Train-Test Split

⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning

📊 Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, etc.)

✔️ Accuracy Achieved: ~84% 

🚀 Future Improvements
📦 Integration into a Streamlit app

📍 Deployment via Flask/FastAPI

🧹 Auto feature selection with PCA

🧪 Cross-validation for better generalization
